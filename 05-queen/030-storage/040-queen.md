Queen Jannike is hibernating inside a glass crystal in Rinkrank's house.

# How to break the glass?
I think the shards of glass on the ground are the key to breaking her free. And what is this spell they are talking about?

# Spell...
Did you search Winfriede's room good?

# Like?
Did you look at the blackboard?

# I did!
So, then you must have half of the spell sorted out.

# Where's the other half?
Look around in Winfriede's room, again.

# What?
There is a painting scrap attached to the mirror.

# Hmm... looks familiar
Indeed. It should match that. ^[ Combine the scrap with the portrait. ]

# The other half
Now, combine them in the inventory to have the full spell.

# Spell to do what?
To command the shards of glass, of course. Go back to the mountain and read the spell to the shards of glass.

# They are slippery!
You would need to control them some other way. ^[ Use your telekinetic powers to the glass pieces. ]

# It is missing a piece
Where could it be?

# Where?
Go look from Winfriede's room. ^[ Look into the drawer. Now the piece is alive. ]

# I found it
Tame it with telekinetic powers. Now you can assemble the glass circle full.
