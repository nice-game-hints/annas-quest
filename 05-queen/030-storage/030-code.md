Winfriede has locked ben into the cage with the electronic code.

# How to get it?
Anna can't see it behind that painting she is using for hiding.

# Right
Look at the painting next to the cage under the garment. The actual painting can be removed from the frame. You could do some spy-level stuff to it.

# Spy-level?
Cut eye holes into the painting.

# With what?
Take it to kitchen and use the knife on the painting.

# Eye holes
Put the adjusted painting back to the frame. Now you can move through the gace door.
