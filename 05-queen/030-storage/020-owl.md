That darn owl is making a scene and alerting Winfriede.

# What to do?
You need a replacement owl, or a bird.

# Replacement?
There is another bird around here.

# Where?
In the kitchen. [The nightingale.](../050-nightingale.md)

# I have the bird
But it doesn't really look like an owl.

# It doesn't
It is not even the same color.

# Color?
Make it black. ^[ There are coals in the cellar. Use the bird on the coals. ]

# It is black, now
Great, go swap it to the owl.

# Hoot!
Hmm... It is making sounds, still... You should stash it somewhere safe.

# Where?
Put it into the cage in the kitchen. Where you took the nightingale.
