There is a very rude princess trying on a glass slipper in her bedroom.

# What to do?
She is in the brink of snapping, for good.

# So?
You could annoy her.

# With what?
There should be a jester in the hallway. I think she would be annoying enough. ^[ Ask the Jester to come to princess' bedroom. ]

# She is there
The princess is not amused. Maybe you could cause some mayhem. ^[ Use your telekinetic powers on the jester to make her drop the balls. ]

# Balls flying
But no desired effect. What if they weren't balls?

# Oh! But what?
I dunno. Like tomatoes.

# Tomatoes?
In the kitchen. There are tomatoes.

# So?
Invite the Jester to kitchen. Then spook her again.

# Tomatoes!
You know what to do next...

# No...
Ask the Jester back to princess' bedroom. Then spook her, again.
