Anna would need a gown for the wedding gala.

# Where to?
Did you look from the cellar? Cindy is there sowing dresses.

# But none for Anna
They are reserved for other guests. Talk to her if she is going to the wedding. Ask about the ball she attended.

# Tree spirit?
Go to the royal garden and talk to the tree.
