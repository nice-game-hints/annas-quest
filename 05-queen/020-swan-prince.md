The Swan Prince came from far away with the glass slipper and his swan. Or is it an actual swan?

# How to get the slipper?
Let's concentrate on the swan, for a moment. Could you get him to prove that the swan is not real?

# How?
Like, cutting its neck with a sword!

# Brutal!
But it is not a real swan. Ask him to show off his sword skills. Try to make him cut the swan neck.

# How?
Try to get the sword to his left hand and then swing from down to up.

# Tell me
 - "Then... they attack you suddenly!"
 - "They have their guard down! Now's your chance!"
 - "But you've won already! You got him!"
 - "Oh, bu he... he strikes your sword hand!"

The sword should be now in his left hand.

# And then?
 - "Then... they attack you suddenly!"
 - "But you've won already! You got him!"

# He did it!
And left the glass slipper behind.
