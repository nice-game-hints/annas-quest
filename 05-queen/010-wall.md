You should first get past the guards.

# How?
There is a piles of hay at the left.

# But they are too high!
You would need to cut them.

# With what?
Did you notice one of the spikes on the wall is broken.

# It is?
Near Reynard. Take if off. ^[ Use your telekinetic powers to detach it. ]

# I have it
Use the spike on the hay stack to make it easier to climb. Anna can now climb the haystack.

# What next?
Help the king ^[ Use telekinetics to drop the fruit. ]. The other guard is now free.

# So?
As the other guard is now away you can use the telekinetic powers to the spear.
