The machine controls are guarded with a cover. Pry it open.

# With what?
Did you try the scissors ^[ You find them on the table. ]?

# They are too thick
You need something more _pointy_.

# What?
Look at the unicorn.

# The horn!
Take it's [horn](040-horn.md).

# I have it
Use the horn on the machine to open the cover.
