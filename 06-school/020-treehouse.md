Hans is in the treehouse. There is a code to access it.

# How to find the code?
It is written down somewhere. Did you find any clues?

# Where to look for them?
Somewhere in the class room, maybe? ^[ Look, again, into your desk. ]

# I got the code
It was "left, right, right, middle, left, right, left".

# Where to enter it?
Next to the treehouse there are three stones. Click on them in order.

"left, right, right, middle, left, right, left"
