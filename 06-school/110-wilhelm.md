Wilhelm would really benefit from a helmet. He is hitting himself with the yoyo constantly.

# Where to?
What looks like a helmet?

# I dunno
The [beehive](100-beehive.md), of course!

# I got it
Give it to Hans. He will remove the wax for the candles. You now have the husk.

# So?
Give the husk to Wilhelm to use as a helmet.
