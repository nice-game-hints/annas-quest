title: Swiping the spell book
---

You would need to steal the spell book under the nose of your mother. Talk to Hans.

# Dry ice
You need gloves to handle it. Check out [the stead](040-key.md).

# I got them
You can now take some dry ice.

# What to do with it?
Throw it into a water in the class room to cause smoke.

# Water?
Into the tea pot.

# She won't let me
Tell Hans you can help him through the window, again. While distracted put the ice into the tea pot.
