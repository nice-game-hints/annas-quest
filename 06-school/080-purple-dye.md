Joringel has those berries. They would make great purple dye.

# How to get them?
He is interested in Jorinde. Talk to both of them. First Jorinde and then tell Joringel someone cares about him.

# He can't do it
If he would show her some token of affection. Like a flower that tells it. Read about it from the biology book.

# A flower?
[Get the flower from Jacob.](065-jacob.md) Give it to Joringel.

# The berries are free
Take the berries from the lunchbox. Give them to Hans.
