Talk to Jacob. Ask about his flower. And tell that you know why he has it. ^[ You have to read the biology book, first. ] Ask him to give it to you.

# He won't
He has passed many messages to Jannike. Has she read them? Ask Jannike about the letters.

# She hasn't seen them
Then they must still be in her desk.

# Her desk
Jannike's desk is the closest to the heater. Open it and click on the stuff. You will find the letter.

# I have the letter
Give it to Jacob.
