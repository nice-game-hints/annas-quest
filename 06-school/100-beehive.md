There is a beehive hanging on the branch of the treehouse.You can reach it through the window.

# I am not touching it!
Bees are usually tamed with spraying gas on them.

# Spraying gas?
There's bellows in the class room chalkboard.

# And the gas?
Take some of the dry ice gas into the bellows.

# It is in
Climb to the window and spray it to the beehive to make it drop.
