The wick of a candle is some kind of a string.

# A string?
Like a yo-yo string?

# Oh!
Talk to Wilhelm.

# He needs a helmet
What would make a good helmet?

# What?
The husk of the [bee hive](100-beehive.md), of course.

# I have the beehive
Give it to Hans, first. He will remove the wax and then you have the husk that can be given to Wilhelm. Give the yoyo to Hans.
