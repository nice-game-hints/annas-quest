There is that highly interesting box with a heart shape on it.

# How to open it?
With a key.

# The rat?
No, you don't need [that key](010-key.md). Look around for more specific key.

# Where?
Open the right-hand drawer downstairs. You get a _heart key_ and a paperweight.

# Heart key!
That will fit the box.
