The skeleton hand is grabbing tight on the handkerchief.

# How to let it loose?
You would need to move its fingers so that the handkerchief gets free.

# How?
Do you have any special things... or powers?

# Powers!
Yes, you can use your telekinesis power to move the fingers.

# It returns
You only get three tries and then it will return to its starting position.

# Okay?
Did you notice something about the fingers. First of all, the pointer finger is locked by the thumb.

# And?
When you lif the little finger, the middle finger will raise, also!

# So?
You can use that to your advance! Four fingers and only three tries.

# Tell me the correct order.
Okay. The order goes like this:
 - Move the thumb
 - Move the pointer finger
 - Move the little finger

The handkerchief is free! Or actually [stuck in the ooze](02-pick.md)
