Oh, how nice cat.

# She is
But she is angry.

# Why is it angry?
_Look_ at the cat.

# She is...
Everyone is angry if they are _sleepy_.

# Sleepy?
Maybe she would want to sleep on a comfy bed.

# Comfy bed?
She needs a comfy, fluffy pillow.. I mean bed.

# Pillow?
There is a pillow upstairs. That should do it.

# It is too flat and sad
The [pillow needs to be fluffier](035-pillow.md)

# It is not inviting enought
[Make it more inviting for the cat.](038-velvet.md)

# It is perfect now
Give it to the cat. She will sleep on it now.
