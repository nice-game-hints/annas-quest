The diamond is attached to the cat's collar.

# It is
But she won't let you take it. She is angry.

# Why is it angry?
_Look_ at the cat.

# She is...
Everyone is angry if they are _sleepy_.

# Sleepy?
Maybe she would want to sleep on a comfy bed.

# Comfy bed?
She needs a comfy, fluffy pillow.. I mean bed.

# Pillow?
There is a pillow upstairs. That should do it.

# It is too flat and sad
The [pillow needs to be fluffier](../035-pillow.md)

# It is not inviting enought
[Make it more inviting for the cat.](../038-velvet.md)

# It is perfect now
Give it to the cat. She will sleep on it. Take the diamond from the cat's collar. Use the diamond on the safe to open one of the locks.
