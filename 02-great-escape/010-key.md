The rat holds on to that key. Try to get it.

# How?
Maybe you could exchange it to something.

# Like?
In every adventure puzzle, when we are dealing with mice and rats, it is always that same thing.

# Cheese?
Exact-o. Get it some cheese.

# Where?
And, as usual, you need to _make_ some cheese-like substance.

# Okay, where to?
Cheese has a _strong smell_. What else has strong smell?

# Drains?
Unclogged drains, yes. Did you find a drain downstairs? ^[ You can find the drain when you move the carpet. ]

# I found it
When you click on it you get some _smelly_ mold.

# Cheese-smelly?
Might be. Give it to the rat.

# It doesn't look like cheese
So, it should be... different color?

# Yellow!
Right. There's some yellow paint at Anna's table, with the art stuff.

# I have the yellow paint
Paint the mold yellow. Give it to the rat to get the key.
