After you [break a hole](01-break.md) you should climb up to it.

# With what?
Some kind of rope would help.

# Where do I get a rope?
Have you read any interesting books, lately?

# Like?
Like a book about party tricks?

# Where?
There is a party trick book in the basement bookshelf. Take it. And read it.

# Many tricks
But one trick is particulary interesting.

# Which one?
Pulling handkerchiefs out of a hat.

# Okay?
You just need a hat. ^[ There is the witch's hat in the upstairs hallway. ]

# I have a hat.
Great! Do the trick then.

# How?
Use the trick book on the hat. You get a handkerchief chain!

# Nice!
You can use it to climb up the hole.

# It's too light
Attach something heavy to it, first. ^[ There is a paperweight in the right drawer downstairs. ]

# I have a weight
Attach the paperweight into the chain and use it on the roof hole.
