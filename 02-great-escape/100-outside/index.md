The best option to get outside for awhile would be the roof.

# How to get there?
How about upstairs?

# Nothing
Maybe the access to the roof is closed down.

# How to find it?
Maybe it would help if you would get access to the blueprints of the house. ^[ Get into the [safe](../020-safe/index.md). ]

# I have the blueprints!
Look at them, then!

# Chimney spot
There is a weak spot in the bedroom now that you can interact with. ^[ You really have to look at the blueprints, first. ] It is the wet looking spot in the roof. [Break through it.](01-break.md)

# It's open!
Now, [climb up there](02-climb.md).
