...over the cauldron they are in.

# What does that mean?
You need a dead person... to have a blessing...

# Okay?
There is one dead person you have met already.

# Joringel!
Talk to him.

# Ring?
Get him the ring ^[ The ring is on the table at the basement. ], first. You have to talk to Joringel, first.

# He's gone!
He went to look for Jorinde. To the other side.

# But the blessing?
Could you contact him?

# How?
Have you read the books in the basement?

# Which one?
About "Communicating With the Other Side".

# Interesting...
Indeed, it instructs you to take a dear object of the deceased with you to sleep.

# To sleep?
First, you need an object of Joringel.

# Like?
[His handkerchief](../080-handkerchief/index.md) should work.

# I have it
Now, just take it to your sleep.

# How?
Put the handkerchief on the bed. You have to read the book first.

# Jorinde!
Follow her to the basement. You will get the blessing over the cauldron.
