You have the amulet but you need to charge it first.

# By the moon?
By the moon. There is moonlight coming from the windows.

# Does not work
Maybe [at outside](../100-outside/index.md) you would have a better change.

# I out there
At the roof in the chimney? Well, there's the moon.

# Doesn't work
The moon is not powerful enough. It should be a full moon.

# I don't have time to wait!
Could you concentrate the moonlight somehow?

# Like?
There is a lens in the chair. Take the lens and use it on the moon. Then use the amulet on the lens to charge it.
