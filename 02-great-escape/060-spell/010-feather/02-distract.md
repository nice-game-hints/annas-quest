The raven won't let you approach it through [the hole](01-reach-raven.md).

# What to do?
It could be distracted.

# By what?
Did you read a book about evil pets in the basement?

# I did
It said that ravens are extremy territorial.

# Okay?
How about if you bring another bird to its territory? Would that distract it enough?

# Another bird?
Or something that looks like a another bird.

# Don't get it
Give it a mirror ^[ Take the mirror in front of the dragon.].
