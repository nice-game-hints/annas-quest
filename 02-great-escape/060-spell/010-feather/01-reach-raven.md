The raven is at the roof but you can't reach it.

# What to do?
Yes, what is that patch next to it?

# Yeah?
The roof is patched. Break through it.

# How?
From the attic.

# With what?
What have you used to break things earlier?

# Oh
Use your telekinetic power on the weak spot. You **have** to look at the spot first outside, from the roof.
