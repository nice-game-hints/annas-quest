One ingredient for the procection spell is a strand of hair from the one you need protection from.

# So, from the witch?
Yup. She won't give you one, naturally.

# Of course
Have you found any trace of her hair somewhere else?

# Where?
In the sink? Look into the sink.o

# It's far down there
Yes. Could you get the sink to flood?

# Flood?
Using the tap will just let the water flow down.

# How to stop it?
There is a loose pipe downstairs. You can detach it. You need to first _look_ into the sink before Anna will remove the pipe.

# It's off
Now, clog it. ^[ There is a cork in the basement. With the bottles. Use the cork. ]

# It is clogged up.
Now open up the tap. It will flood and you get the hair.
