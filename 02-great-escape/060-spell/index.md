You need to do a protection spell to get past the witch.

# What spell?
The mirror will tell you.

# Tell me.
You need:
 - [Raven's feather](010-feather/index.md)
 - [A strand of hair from the one you need protection from](020-hair.md)
 - [A blessing from a dead over the cauldron they are in](030-blessing.md)
 - [An amulet charged by the moon](040-amulet.md)

# I have those
Add the feather and the hair into the cauldron. Now [heat the cauldron](050-heat.md) and dip the charged amulet in there.
