The thieves took the house they were supposed to be housed in. Go and confront the thieves.

# They threw me out
But they seem to be little intimidated by... _ghosts_.

# Ghosts?
Could you scare them away?

# How?
Build a ghost figure to scare them. The bedsheet ^[ At the alley. Use your telekinetic powers to get it. ] is a good start.

# It's broken
[Fix the bedsheet.](100-bedsheet.md)

# Neat
It would need something more. Like, eyes.

# Eyes?
Cut eyes into the fixed bedsheet. ^[ Use scissors. ]

# Starts to look like a ghost
What are the thieves talking about? Glowy eyes?

# Glowy?
Make the eyes glow with light.

# Light?
Visit [the store](053-store.md).

# Oh, I have it
You have [the fixed lantern](085-lantern.md)? Put it into the ghost figure to make it glow. Use the fake ghost on the house to scare them away.

# They don't believe it
Make it move. Use your telekinetic powers on it to make it float. Go tell the musicians they can move in now.
