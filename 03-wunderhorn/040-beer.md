Gil is drinking beer. And the bartender is serving more.

# What to do?
Did you look at the taps?

# One for beer, one for water
Yes, and the pipes on the wall must have something to do with it, clearly. Look at them.

# Yes, interesting...
There is one for water and one for beer, again.

# Indeed
You could mess with the pipes.

# I could! But how?
With telekinetic powers, of course. They will be switched.

# Water for Gil
Say to the bartender that Gil would need another drink.

# Not fooling him
Hmm... maybe you could get rid of _all_ of the beer.

# How?
Did you examine the fountain outside, already? Where is it getting its water?

# I dunno?
Look at the pipe near the ground.

# So...
The water is coming from the tavern pumps!

# Oh, really?
Do you see where we are going here?

# I think I do
So, get back in and switch the pipes again. Don't tell the bartender!

# They're switched
Now, pump all the beer away from the tavern using the fountain lever.
