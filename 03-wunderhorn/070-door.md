Theodor must've told you about the door. It is shut down and can be only opened by solving the clues.

# Clues?
Yes. Note that you _must_ have talked with Theodore about the clues before Anna will find them.

# Check
Now, onwards and find out the clues!

# Any... clues?
Those two big windows look interesting.

# Indeed
Look at the right window. Anna will spot some peculiar symbols in the corner.

# Okay?
Wouldn't it be nicer if the symbols were more light up?

# Light up?
Or the whole window would have more light. Go to the back alley to find the lamp post.

# What to do with it?
[Light it up.](075-lamp-post.md)

# It is lit
What is it lighting? 

# The window?
Yes. But also the church organ.

# Interesting...
You would just have to know [what keys to play](075-organ.md).
