It is an orb of great power.

It can be found from the woods beyond the mill, in the depths of a lake protected by Weisse Frauen. Ghostly spirits that haunt the waters. Whatever you do, don't go into the water.

First, [you have to get into the woods](030-woods.md).

# I found the lake
Hans saved you. He said the Weisse Frauen are different around music.

# More hints?
A band was playing earlier with a wooden stringed instrument to them.

# A band!
There are the musicians.

# True
[Help them to their house.](057-musicians.md) I'm sure they will appreciate your help. ^[ After getting them into the house go knock the door, again. ]

# Well...
You got an instrument from them. Maybe you have to do the playing. Go play the violin to Weisse Frauen.

# It sounds awful!
Is it the musician or the instrument?

# Which one?
You could find a better violin.

# Where?
In the store. [Get the better violin](130-violin.md) from there.

# I have magical violin
Go play to the Weisse Frauen with the magical violin.
