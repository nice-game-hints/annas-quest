[The red dragon](080-dragon.md) got you into the top of the Glass Mountain. Knock at the door.

# He has the rose!
Indeed, get it from him.

# How?
Rinkrank doesn't let you in through the _door_.

# Door?
How about the window?

# It's locked
You have special powers, don't you. Use telekinetic powers on the window.

# He sees me
Yes, he _sees_ you. Could you take care that he won't see you.

# How?
Hide.

# Where?
Click on the rocks. Anna will hide behind the rocks. Then open the window.

# What then?
Could you trap him?

# Trap?
Use the telekinetic powers again on the window. His beard will trap him. Now go talk to him and you get the rose.
