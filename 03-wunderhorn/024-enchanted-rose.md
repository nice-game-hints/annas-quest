An Enchanted rose, from the tops of Glass Mountain.

The tale goes that a dragon once gave passage to those that were worthy. You should speak to the minister of the church. He would know more on the legend.

# I spoke to him
He will tell you about a dragon carrying right-hearted person from the bell tower.

Did you ask him about the windows? Did you ask him about the paintings? Did you as where the bell tower is?

# Yes, yes, yes
So, then Theodor said that [opening the door](070-door.md) is a game of clues.

# I opened the door
Great! Now, call the dragon.

# How?
Ring the bell. ^[ Ring the bell with your telekinetic powers. ]

# The red dragon!
She came. [But she is mad!](080-dragon.md)

# Got a lift
You are at the [Glass Mountain](090-mountain.md).
