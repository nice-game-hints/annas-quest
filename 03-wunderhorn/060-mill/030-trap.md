You could use the trap door against the witch.

# How?
If you could pull the trap door when she is on top of it!

# That would be cool!
Do it!

# How?
You would need some long line. ^[ Go get the clothesline from the alley. Use your telekinetic power on the bedsheet. ]

# I have a line
Now, get into the mill basement through the hatch.

# I'm in
Set up the trapping mechanism with the clothesline.

# Tell me how
Tie the clothseline into the trap door mechanism.
