The spellbook is protected with a strong spell.

# How to counter it?
Who else knows about spells than the mill witch?

# Who?
The sorceress, of course! Talk to her about the spell.

# It is a chant spell
You should first know how the spell went to counter it.

# How do I do that?
Did you talk to the witch, at the basement?

# Right!
Ask her questions. Maybe she would tell you the chant.

# She is angry
Well, I can get that. Maybe you could steer the conversation and be kind to her. Maybe she would then slip the chant out.

# How?
Did you ask "Why do you have to kidnap all these kids, anyway?" Now you can tell that you are on her side. ^[ Option: I'm on your side, you know ]

# And then?
Say: *sigh* You're right... No one could ever be as great witch as you are...

# Okay, she is more happy
Now say that "I've dabbled in protection spells a little bit. Do you think I could figure it out?"

# She doesn't believe in you
Ask her: Do you remember the spell you used to protect the book?

# She told it!
At least the beginning. Now you need the counter spell.

# Who will tell it?
The sorceress. Go talk to her. Say that you think you might know at least some of the chant. You now know the counterspell and can get the book.
