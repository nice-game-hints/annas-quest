First you need to get into the mill.

# How?
Talk to Gottfried. He will be in the tavern after you have visited [the woods](030-woods.md).

# He is there, and sad
Why is he sad though?

# He didn't say
Maybe someone else would know. Someone who knows about everyone.

# Like?
Like the bartender. Ask why Gottfrid is so sad.

# He lost his child
That is sad. Tell to Gottfrid you can help to find his boy.

# I did it
So, Hansel, his son, was lost somewhere near the _mill_. Go visit the mill, again. Now, there is smoke coming from the chimney. Go knock on the door.
