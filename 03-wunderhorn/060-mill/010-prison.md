You are trapped with Hansel in the cage.

# How to get out?
What did Hansel say about the support beam?

# He kicked it
Kick it, too.

# Not enough force
You would need a tool.

# What?
Take the hammer from the table. ^[ Use telekinesis on the hammer. ]

# I have the hammer
Hit the beam with it.

# The keys!
They dropped on top of the trap door!

# So...
Open the trap door!

# How?
The trap door mechanism is visible on the roof.

# And?
Could you mess with it? Like you mess with everything else.

# Don't get it
Use your telekinetic powers on the trap door mechanism.

# It broke!
Nevermind with that. Use your telekinetic powers again on the trap door mechanism. You will get the key and open the door.

Get out of the basement. ^[ Use your telekinetic powers to break the lock. ]
