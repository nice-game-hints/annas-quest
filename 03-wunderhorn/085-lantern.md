The lantern you got from [the store](053-store.md) is broken.

# How to fix it?
The right question is _who_ would fix it.

# Well, who?
The blacksmith, or his daughter.

# The daughter is busy
[Help the blacksmith, first.](045-blacksmith.md)

# Blacksmith is back
Now get the lantern to the store. She will fix it.
