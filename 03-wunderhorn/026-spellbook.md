The witch took it! Get it back!

# Where is she?
You will find out, soon. Have you visited [the woods](030-woods.md), already?

# Yes, I have
Great! That mill looks suspicious. Ask around.

# Where?
Like, in the tavern. There is the sad man, [Gofftried](060-mill/index.md).

# I got into the mill
Great, now [escape from the prison](060-mill/010-prison.md).

# I'm out of there
Now, get back. You still need the spell book. [Get rid of the witch.](060-mill/020-catch.md)

# She's taken care of
Good. Now, [remove the spell protecting the book](060-mill/040-spell.md). Then you get it.
