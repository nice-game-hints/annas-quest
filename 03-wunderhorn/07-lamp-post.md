In the alley there is a lamp post. It does not have light.

# I want it lit
Okay, first you would need to reach them.

# How?
Use your telekinetic power. If Anna does not want to do it follow the [enchanted rose guide](024-enchanted-rose.md).

# I think I have a reason now
Then the lamp post should bend when using the telekinetic powers into it.

# How to light it?
You need fire.

# Fire?
You had the fiery friend, the baby dragon.

# Oh yeah!
Just ignite him. He needs to eat something.

# What?
There are coals in the tavern. Use the baby dragon on the coals to get him spit fire. Use the fiery dragon on the bent lamp post to lit it.
