One last thing to get out of the dungeon is the group release form. When you [talk to the Devil](070-bigtroll.md) he will command the Admin Troll to write one.

# But it takes ages!
Yeah, we don't have 200 years. Could you _mess_ up with him a little?

# Mess up?
Like tilt the inkpot on the paper? ^[ Use the telekinetic power on the inkpot. ]

# He throws them away!
And does not even hit the bear cages! His sight is rusty!

# The bear cages?
Indeed... Maybe a bear cage could catch it.

# How?
The paper would first hit the _left_ (from the levers) cage. You just have to put it in correct position.

# What position?
Full up. Push the left lever full up.

# It only hit that
And next, it would hit the right cage and finally the middle cage. You would need to put them so that the left is full up, right one is in the middle and the middle cage is all the way down.

# How do they work?
The goal was: left up, middle down and right middle.

Here are the lever actions:
 - left lever down causes right one up
 - left lever up causes right one down
 - middle lever down causes right all up, left one up
 - middle lever up causes right all down, left one down
 - right lever up causes middle one down
 - right lever down causes middle one up

# Help!
Reset the levers and do following:
 - Middle lever one down
 - Middle lever one down
 - Left lever one down
 - Left lever one up

# Positioned
Go tilt the inkpot, again. The baby bear has the form now.

# How to get it?
Use the middle lever to raise the baby bear into the middle. Give the honey to it.
