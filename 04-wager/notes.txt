Thief's story
 He has many guises, you see, but... few have looked upon his hideous, true self...
 A man I once met, he saw it. He was a thief who broke into a great and wealthy mansion...
 He thend hid, in a cupboard, until the midnight hour...
 Just before the time for the theft was right, he saw it, through the keyhole...
 A sight most horrifying an indescribable beast, gorging itself on... unidentifiable hunks of meat.
 This thief... he shook with fear. Be cautious, dear child...


A sigh t most horrifying
This thief, he shook with fear. Be cautious

It is old horses hoof. That's what the guards say.
