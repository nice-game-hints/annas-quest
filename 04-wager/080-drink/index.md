keywords: sweet, juicy, creamy, thick, watermelon

The Big Troll is blocking the entry to the head office. He wants a drink.

The drink should contain:
 - [Sumtin' sweet](../050-honeyjar.md)
 - [Sumtin' juicy](010-watermelon.md)
 - [Sumtin' a liddle thick and creamy](020-thick.md)

# I have them
Use the blender glass on the table to mix them.

# It's broken
Maybe you need another [blender](030-mixing.md).

# It is ready!
But just giving it to the troll does not help. Keep an eye on [something that could help you](../090-special.md).

# I got it
Mix it in the blender and give the whole drink to the troll. He will now sleep and you can do your thing.
