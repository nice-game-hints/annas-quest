The cell door is locked. [Get rid of the guard](005-guard.md), first.

# The guard is away
You should pick the lock in the door.

# With what?
Have you searched around?

# Yes!
In the mattress? Take a spring.

# I have a spring
Use that to pick the lock.

# It is not shaped correctly
Well, shape it then.

# How?
With telekinesis. Use the brain in the inventory.
