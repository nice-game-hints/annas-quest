Poor royal gardener Wilfred is going to get executed.

# Awful
You have to save him. What is this show, even? There is audience and they show on the screen what is going to happen to him.

# That red screen?
Yes, it shows he is going to get executed by an axe.

# Axe!
Could you... get rid of the axe? ^[ Use telekinesis on the axe. ]

# New game!
Well, now he is going to get hanged! Talk to the executioner.

# Inspection?
He does not pull the lever unless the trapdoor is inspected. Who does all the bureacracy around here?

# The admin troll?
Go talk to him about the trapdoor inspection. You can now do the inspection for the trapdoor.

# It is dark
[Get some light in there.](035-dark.md)

# Yikes!
Old prisoner. [Maybe you could get him some water.](037-water.md)
