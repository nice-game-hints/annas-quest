If I were to make a meal of my finest, then what would my meal be?

# A meal?
You have to find out _three_ things about the Devil's meal.

# Three?
Go ask around. Others will tell about
 - Horse's hoof ^[ Ask Wilfred about Devil's finest meal. ]
 - Dead dogfish ^[ Ask from the sleeping Big Troll. ]

# What about the third one?
This is not with a person, but a file.

# File?
In the file cabinets.

# What to do?
Look at file cabinet first. Anna will spot that there is information about riddles.

# And then?
Use telekinetic powers to get a paper out of the cabinet. Note that Anna **must** look at the cabinets, first.

# Read about the rib of a whale
You have now all the pieces for the riddle. Go tell them to the Devil.

# In what order?
 - A dead dogfish from the Great North Sea...
 - The spoon is ^[ The rib of a whale... ]
 - The wineglass is ^[ An old horse's hoof. ]
