If 'better the devil you know,' they say, then tell me, Anna... what do you know of the Devil?

# Yeah, what do I know?
Nothing, yet. You would need to find someone more knowing. He is in the cell [behind the sick troll](100-sicktroll.md).

# I am there
It is the Wizard of Wunderhorn! Ask him about the Devil.

# It is a story?
That story contains the elements you need to solve the riddle.

# Tell it again
The story went like this:
He has many guises, you see, but... few have looked upon his hideous, true self...
A man I once met, he saw it. He was a thief who broke into a great and wealthy mansion...
He then hid, in a cupboard, until the midnight hour...
Just before the time for the theft was right, he saw it, through the keyhole...
A sight most horrifying an indescribable beast, gorging itself on... unidentifiable hunks of meat.
This thief... he shook with fear. Be cautious, dear child...

# I can't make it
First hint:

A sight most horrifying an indescribable beast, gorging itself on... unidentifiable hunks of meat.

# Hunks of meat?
There's piles of meat in the Wizard's cell. Take one from there. Give it to the Devil. ^[ Knock on the door and talk about the knowing riddle. Anna will give the meat. ]

# Well, he is probably eating there...
Second hint:

Just before the time for the theft was right, he saw it, through the keyhole...

# Keyhole?
There is a keyhole in the Devil's door. Look through it by looking at the door.

# The Devil!
In his true form! The riddle is solved.
