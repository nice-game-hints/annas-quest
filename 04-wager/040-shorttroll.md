The Short Troll is guarding the utility closet. He is teamed up with the goat.

# Okay
Maybe the goat is the key here.

# What about it?
Talk to the Short Troll.

# Yeah?
He says the goat is now calm but if gets riled up will kick all over.

# Riled up?
Maybe if it would eat something... unsuitable.

# What?
Give it some chillies. ^[ You find chillies from the table at the hallway. ]
