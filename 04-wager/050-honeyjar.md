The small bear is holding on to the honey jar (in the middle cage). You can get it.

# How?
The levers on the left control the cages.

# Not quite straightforward
Yeah. They work like this:
 - left lever down, right one up
 - left lever up, right one down
 - middle lever down, right all up, left one up
 - middle lever up, right all down, left one down
 - right lever up, middle one down
 - right lever down, middle one up

# Okay, what am I trying to achieve?
Do you notice what the baby bear does when it is next to its parents? It will extend its arm.

# Right!
So, get it between its parents. And it should be in the middle position for Anna to grab the jar.

# Let's try that
Here are the lever actions, once more:
 - left lever down, right one up
 - left lever up, right one down
 - middle lever down, right all up, left one up
 - middle lever up, right all down, left one down
 - right lever up, middle one down
 - right lever down, middle one up

# Help me!
Reset and do the following: 
 - middle lever down
 - middle lever down
 - left lever down
 - right lever down

# Everything in the middle
Great! Now you can grab the honey jar.
