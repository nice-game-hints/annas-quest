There is no point of opening the door if the guard is there... guarding.

# How to get rid of him?
There isn't really any items, either.

# So?
Maybe talking is the way. Talk to the guard. Talk to him about Winfriede. Then talk to him how he doesn't like it here.

# Did
Did Reynard come?

# Yes?
Talk to Reynard about the guard. Say that he wants to quit. Reynard gets rid of him. Remember, you can use Reynard's help later.
