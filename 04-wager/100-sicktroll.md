There is a sick troll guarding the other cell.

# How to get past it?
There is not much you can do until you get past the [Big Troll](070-bigtroll.md).

# He is done, now
So, did you check the mailbox?

# It is a letter
It is a notice of termination. The small troll guarding your cell is released from his position.

# Okay...
Say, could you use that same letter to fool the sick troll to leave his position, too?

# Interesting
But the letter is targeted towards the small troll. You would have to forge the letter somehow.

# How?
With a pencil. The Admin Troll surely isn't helping with that. ^[ Give the notice of termination to Wilfred. ]

# It is changed now
Then, take it into execution.

# Where?
Show it to the Admin Troll. The sick troll is now gone and you can enter the cell.
