The [drink](080-drink/index.md) would need one more ingredient to get Anna past the Big Troll.

# What?
I guess it could be a flower. Did you talk to the gardener? ^[ Wilfred, he is going to get executed. ]

# I did
Sleep spores of passibicac, say? Sounds quite interesting. If his hands are tied, you have to [free him](030-wilfred.md), first.

# He is free
Ask about the passibicac. He will draw it to you.

# I have the drawing
Now, there are now flowers in the dungeons. Maybe someone outside might be of help.

# Outside?
Remember Reynard? ^[ Go to your cell and use the flower drawing on the grate. ]
